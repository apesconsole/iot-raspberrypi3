# iot-raspberrypi3

The project runs a web application and provides an user interface to interact with GPIO.
It provides a Login and a subsequent home screen upon validation. The home screen displays 3 main zones.
The Login also displays a Selection of Roles. Validation runs through the roles of the valid user and 
displays the active Zones available to control for a specific user.
* Hall
* Master Room
* Guest Room

Each of the Zones can have their own set of appliances and can be contolled by the application.
* The sample project does not connect to any Database for the user validation.

### Prerequisites
* Raspberry pi 3 Model B
* Replay Switches

Refer the GPIO pin numbers for the specific board before connection.

### Installations
* Raspbian
* Tomcat
* pi4j
* Maven

### Project Set up
The project refers to Bootstrap and jQuery for the UI. Download them separately and have them under 
```
src\main\webapp\resources
```
If the start up fails to initialise, it is most likely that you should give root access to the user and possibley have to build it in th e root direcory. The pi4J will not have access if the user does not have root access.

### Built With
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

### Deployment
Once Deployed Tomcat should start up the application 
```
I have renamed my Raspberry Host 'sampi' and configured Tomcat instance to run on 9080
